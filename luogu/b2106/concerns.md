## arent they same?
```
what is the diff of me using:

ret[i][j] = g[j][i]

and ret[j][i] = g[i][j]

arent they same?
```


The two assignments `ret[i][j] = g[j][i]` and `ret[j][i] = g[i][j]` are not the same because they place the elements of the original matrix `g` into different positions in the transposed matrix `ret`.

To illustrate the difference, let's break down what each assignment does:

1. **Using `ret[i][j] = g[j][i]`:**
   - This means you are trying to place the element `g[j][i]` from the original matrix into the position `[i][j]` in the transposed matrix.
   - However, this does not achieve the transposition correctly because you are not swapping the rows and columns properly.

2. **Using `ret[j][i] = g[i][j]`:**
   - This correctly places the element `g[i][j]` from the original matrix into the position `[j][i]` in the transposed matrix.
   - This correctly swaps the rows and columns to form the transposed matrix.

To see the effect more clearly, let's take an example:

Original matrix `g`:
```
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
```

Using `ret[i][j] = g[j][i]`:
- When `i=0, j=0`, `ret[0][0] = g[0][0] = 1` (correct so far)
- When `i=0, j=1`, `ret[0][1] = g[1][0] = 4` (incorrect position)
- When `i=0, j=2`, `ret[0][2] = g[2][0] = 7` (incorrect position)
- Continuing this way will result in incorrect transposition.

Using `ret[j][i] = g[i][j]`:
- When `i=0, j=0`, `ret[0][0] = g[0][0] = 1` (correct position)
- When `i=0, j=1`, `ret[1][0] = g[0][1] = 2` (correct position)
- When `i=0, j=2`, `ret[2][0] = g[0][2] = 3` (correct position)
- Continuing this way results in the correct transposition.

Here's the code that performs the correct transposition:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

n, m = map(int, input().split())
g = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]

# Initialize the transposed matrix with dimensions m x n
ret = [[0] * n for _ in range(m)]

# Fill in the transposed matrix
for i in range(n):
  for j in range(m):
    ret[j][i] = g[i][j]

# Print the transposed matrix
for row in ret:
  print(' '.join(map(str, row)))
```

This will correctly transpose the matrix and produce the desired output.

Let's dive deeper into the transposition process and understand why `ret[j][i] = g[i][j]` is the correct way to transpose a matrix.

### Understanding Matrix Transposition

Transposing a matrix means swapping its rows with its columns. If you have a matrix `A` with dimensions `n x m`, the transposed matrix `A^T` will have dimensions `m x n`. In other words, the element at position `(i, j)` in the original matrix `A` will move to position `(j, i)` in the transposed matrix `A^T`.

### Example Matrix

Consider the following 3x3 matrix:

Original matrix `A`:
```
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
```

Transposed matrix `A^T` should be:
```
1 4 7
2 5 8
3 6 9
```

### How Transposition Works

To achieve this, we need to iterate over each element in the original matrix `A` and place it in the correct position in the transposed matrix `A^T`.

### Correct Transposition Assignment

When we use `ret[j][i] = g[i][j]`, here's what happens:
1. **Initialization**: We initialize `ret` with dimensions `m x n`.
   ```python
   ret = [[0] * n for _ in range(m)]
   ```
   This means `ret` is a matrix with `m` rows and `n` columns.

2. **Iterate Over Original Matrix**: We iterate over each element in the original matrix `g` using two nested loops:
   ```python
   for i in range(n):
     for j in range(m):
       ret[j][i] = g[i][j]
   ```

   - For `i = 0`, `j = 0`: `ret[0][0] = g[0][0] = 1`
   - For `i = 0`, `j = 1`: `ret[1][0] = g[0][1] = 2`
   - For `i = 0`, `j = 2`: `ret[2][0] = g[0][2] = 3`
   - For `i = 1`, `j = 0`: `ret[0][1] = g[1][0] = 4`
   - For `i = 1`, `j = 1`: `ret[1][1] = g[1][1] = 5`
   - For `i = 1`, `j = 2`: `ret[2][1] = g[1][2] = 6`
   - For `i = 2`, `j = 0`: `ret[0][2] = g[2][0] = 7`
   - For `i = 2`, `j = 1`: `ret[1][2] = g[2][1] = 8`
   - For `i = 2`, `j = 2`: `ret[2][2] = g[2][2] = 9`

This correctly builds the transposed matrix `ret`.

### Why `ret[i][j] = g[j][i]` is Incorrect

Using `ret[i][j] = g[j][i]` incorrectly places elements because it does not swap the indices properly. To illustrate this with the same example:

- For `i = 0`, `j = 0`: `ret[0][0] = g[0][0] = 1`
- For `i = 0`, `j = 1`: `ret[0][1] = g[1][0] = 4` (incorrect, should be `g[0][1]`)
- For `i = 0`, `j = 2`: `ret[0][2] = g[2][0] = 7` (incorrect, should be `g[0][2]`)
- For `i = 1`, `j = 0`: `ret[1][0] = g[0][1] = 2` (incorrect, should be `g[1][0]`)
- For `i = 1`, `j = 1`: `ret[1][1] = g[1][1] = 5` (this happens to be correct)
- For `i = 1`, `j = 2`: `ret[1][2] = g[2][1] = 8` (incorrect, should be `g[1][2]`)
- For `i = 2`, `j = 0`: `ret[2][0] = g[0][2] = 3` (incorrect, should be `g[2][0]`)
- For `i = 2`, `j = 1`: `ret[2][1] = g[1][2] = 6` (incorrect, should be `g[2][1]`)
- For `i = 2`, `j = 2`: `ret[2][2] = g[2][2] = 9`

This results in an incorrect transposed matrix.

### Key Takeaways

- When transposing a matrix, ensure that the element at position `(i, j)` in the original matrix is placed at position `(j, i)` in the transposed matrix.
- Use `ret[j][i] = g[i][j]` to correctly perform the transposition.
- Always verify the dimensions of the resulting matrix. For an `n x m` matrix, the transposed matrix should be `m x n`.

### Summary

Hereâ€™s the corrected and detailed code for transposing a matrix:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

n, m = map(int, input().split())
g = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]

# Initialize the transposed matrix with dimensions m x n
ret = [[0] * n for _ in range(m)]

# Fill in the transposed matrix
for i in range(n):
  for j in range(m):
    ret[j][i] = g[i][j]

# Print the transposed matrix
for row in ret:
  print(' '.join(map(str, row)))
```

This code will ensure that the transposition is done correctly and the output will match the expected transposed matrix.

Let's go further into the details of matrix transposition and some general considerations for similar problems.

### Detailed Breakdown of Matrix Transposition

#### Step-by-Step Example

Let's consider the given example with a 3x3 matrix again:

Original matrix `A`:
```
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
```

1. **Initialization**:
   We initialize the transposed matrix `ret` to be `m x n`. For a 3x3 matrix, this will also be a 3x3 matrix, but the logic applies to any `n x m` matrix.
   ```python
   ret = [[0] * n for _ in range(m)]
   ```
   This creates a matrix of zeros with `m` rows and `n` columns.

2. **Transposing**:
   We iterate over each element in the original matrix `A` and place it in the transposed position in `ret`.

   - **First Row** (`i=0`):
     - `ret[0][0] = g[0][0] = 1`
     - `ret[1][0] = g[0][1] = 2`
     - `ret[2][0] = g[0][2] = 3`
   - **Second Row** (`i=1`):
     - `ret[0][1] = g[1][0] = 4`
     - `ret[1][1] = g[1][1] = 5`
     - `ret[2][1] = g[1][2] = 6`
   - **Third Row** (`i=2`):
     - `ret[0][2] = g[2][0] = 7`
     - `ret[1][2] = g[2][1] = 8`
     - `ret[2][2] = g[2][2] = 9`

   This results in the transposed matrix:
   ```
   1 4 7
   2 5 8
   3 6 9
   ```

### Common Pitfalls

1. **Incorrect Index Assignment**:
   Using `ret[i][j] = g[j][i]` instead of `ret[j][i] = g[i][j]` can seem correct when `n == m` (a square matrix) because the dimensions don't change, but this logic fails for non-square matrices.

2. **Matrix Dimensions**:
   Always ensure that the dimensions of the transposed matrix are correctly initialized. For a matrix `A` of size `n x m`, the transposed matrix should be `m x n`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   Consider edge cases such as:
   - A single row or column matrix.
   - Large matrices close to the constraint limits.

### General Approach for Similar Problems

1. **Understanding Requirements**:
   Clearly understand what transformation or operation is required. For transposition, it means swapping rows with columns.

2. **Initial Setup**:
   Properly initialize your result matrix with the correct dimensions.

3. **Loop Through Elements**:
   Use nested loops to iterate over the elements and perform the required operation, ensuring you access and store elements in the correct order.

4. **Test With Multiple Cases**:
   Test your code with different matrix sizes, including edge cases, to ensure correctness.

### Example for Non-Square Matrix

Let's consider a 3x2 matrix:

Original matrix `A`:
```
1 2
3 4
5 6
```

Expected transposed matrix `A^T`:
```
1 3 5
2 4 6
```

Applying the correct logic:

1. **Initialization**:
   ```python
   ret = [[0] * n for _ in range(m)]
   ```
   This creates a matrix of zeros with `m` rows and `n` columns.

2. **Transposing**:
   - For `i=0`:
     - `ret[0][0] = g[0][0] = 1`
     - `ret[1][0] = g[0][1] = 2`
   - For `i=1`:
     - `ret[0][1] = g[1][0] = 3`
     - `ret[1][1] = g[1][1] = 4`
   - For `i=2`:
     - `ret[0][2] = g[2][0] = 5`
     - `ret[1][2] = g[2][1] = 6`

This results in the correct transposed matrix.

### Key Takeaways

1. **Indexing**:
   - Use `ret[j][i] = g[i][j]` for transposition.
   - Understand the role of `i` and `j` in iterating over rows and columns.

2. **Matrix Initialization**:
   - Always initialize the transposed matrix with the correct dimensions.

3. **Validation**:
   - Test your solution with various matrix sizes to ensure robustness.

By following these principles, you can handle matrix transposition and similar operations accurately and efficiently.
