Let's clarify the purpose of the matrix initialization and how it works for rotating a matrix 90 degrees clockwise.

### Understanding the Matrix Initialization

When rotating an `n x m` matrix 90 degrees clockwise, the resulting matrix will have dimensions `m x n`. This is because the rows of the original matrix become the columns of the new matrix.

### Input and Output Explanation

1. **Input**:
   - First line: Two integers `n` (number of rows) and `m` (number of columns).
   - Next `n` lines: Each line contains `m` integers representing the matrix elements.

2. **Output**:
   - The output should be the matrix rotated 90 degrees clockwise. The resulting matrix will have `m` rows and `n` columns.

### Matrix Initialization in the Code

In the original matrix `g`, you have `n` rows and `m` columns. When you rotate this matrix, the new matrix `ret` should have `m` rows and `n` columns.

Therefore, you initialize the transposed matrix `ret` with `m` rows, each containing `n` columns:
```python
ret = [[0] * n for _ in range(m)]
```
This creates a list of `m` sublists, each containing `n` zeros.

### Why `[0] * n for _ in range(m)`

1. **Dimensions**:
   - The original matrix `g` has dimensions `n x m`.
   - After rotation, the matrix `ret` should have dimensions `m x n`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - `[0] * n` creates a list with `n` zeros. This represents a single row in the transposed matrix.
   - `for _ in range(m)` repeats this row `m` times to create `m` rows, each with `n` zeros.

### Example

Given the example matrix:
```
3 3
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
```

After rotating 90 degrees clockwise, the resulting matrix should be:
```
7 4 1
8 5 2
9 6 3
```

### Correct Code

Here is the correct code with detailed comments:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

# Read the dimensions of the matrix
n, m = map(int, input().split())

# Read the original matrix
g = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]

# Initialize the rotated matrix with dimensions m x n
ret = [[0] * n for _ in range(m)]

# Fill in the rotated matrix
for i in range(n):
  for j in range(m):
    ret[j][n - i - 1] = g[i][j]

# Print the rotated matrix
for row in ret:
  print(' '.join(map(str, row)))
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Read Dimensions**:
   ```python
   n, m = map(int, input().split())
   ```
   - `n` is the number of rows.
   - `m` is the number of columns.

2. **Read the Matrix**:
   ```python
   g = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]
   ```
   - Read the next `n` lines, each containing `m` integers, and store them in the list `g`.

3. **Initialize the Rotated Matrix**:
   ```python
   ret = [[0] * n for _ in range(m)]
   ```
   - Create a matrix with `m` rows and `n` columns, all initialized to zero.

4. **Fill the Rotated Matrix**:
   ```python
   for i in range(n):
     for j in range(m):
       ret[j][n - i - 1] = g[i][j]
   ```
   - For each element `g[i][j]` in the original matrix, place it in the correct position `ret[j][n - i - 1]` in the rotated matrix.

5. **Print the Rotated Matrix**:
   ```python
   for row in ret:
     print(' '.join(map(str, row)))
   ```
   - Print each row of the rotated matrix.

This approach ensures the matrix is correctly rotated 90 degrees clockwise.

Understanding how to manipulate indices to achieve desired transformations, such as rotating a matrix, can indeed be challenging. Let's break down the process and develop a systematic approach to solving these types of problems.

### Systematic Approach to Matrix Transformations

1. **Understand the Transformation**:
   - Visualize what the transformation looks like.
   - For a 90-degree clockwise rotation, the first column of the original matrix becomes the first row of the transposed matrix.

2. **Identify Index Mapping**:
   - Determine how the indices of the original matrix map to the indices of the transformed matrix.

3. **Create a Plan**:
   - Write down the mapping rules.
   - Translate these rules into nested loops for filling the new matrix.

### Example: 90-Degree Clockwise Rotation

#### Visualizing the Transformation

For a matrix:
```
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
```

After a 90-degree clockwise rotation:
```
7 4 1
8 5 2
9 6 3
```

#### Index Mapping

- The element at position `(0, 0)` in the original matrix moves to `(0, 2)` in the rotated matrix.
- The element at position `(0, 1)` in the original matrix moves to `(1, 2)` in the rotated matrix.
- The element at position `(0, 2)` in the original matrix moves to `(2, 2)` in the rotated matrix.

Generalizing:
- The element at position `(i, j)` in the original matrix moves to `(j, n - 1 - i)` in the rotated matrix.

#### Plan

1. Initialize the rotated matrix with the correct dimensions.
2. Use nested loops to iterate over each element of the original matrix.
3. Place each element in its new position based on the mapping rule.

### Applying the Plan

#### Step-by-Step Example

1. **Initialization**:
   ```python
   ret = [[0] * n for _ in range(m)]
   ```
   This creates a `m x n` matrix filled with zeros.

2. **Mapping Indices**:
   ```python
   for i in range(n):
     for j in range(m):
       ret[j][n - 1 - i] = g[i][j]
   ```

### Code Explanation

Let's go through the code:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

# Read the dimensions of the matrix
n, m = map(int, input().split())

# Read the original matrix
g = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]

# Initialize the rotated matrix with dimensions m x n
ret = [[0] * n for _ in range(m)]

# Fill in the rotated matrix
for i in range(n):
  for j in range(m):
    ret[j][n - 1 - i] = g[i][j]

# Print the rotated matrix
for row in ret:
  print(' '.join(map(str, row)))
```

1. **Reading the Matrix**:
   - `n, m = map(int, input().split())`: Reads the number of rows and columns.
   - `g = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]`: Reads the `n x m` matrix.

2. **Initialization**:
   - `ret = [[0] * n for _ in range(m)]`: Creates a `m x n` matrix filled with zeros.

3. **Index Mapping**:
   - `for i in range(n):`: Iterates over rows.
   - `for j in range(m):`: Iterates over columns.
   - `ret[j][n - 1 - i] = g[i][j]`: Places each element from the original matrix into its new position in the rotated matrix.

4. **Printing the Result**:
   - `for row in ret: print(' '.join(map(str, row)))`: Prints each row of the rotated matrix.

### General Tips for Index Mapping

1. **Understand the Desired Transformation**:
   - Visualize or sketch the transformation.
   - Identify how rows and columns are rearranged.

2. **Mapping Rules**:
   - Write down the mapping for a few elements to identify a pattern.
   - Generalize the pattern into a mapping rule.

3. **Translate to Code**:
   - Use nested loops to iterate over the original matrix.
   - Apply the mapping rule to place elements in the new matrix.

4. **Verify**:
   - Test with small, easy-to-verify matrices.
   - Ensure the dimensions of the new matrix are correct.

By following these steps, you can systematically approach and solve matrix transformation problems.
