Certainly! Let's break down why the line `print(d[i] if i in d else chr(ord(i)+3) for i in a)` is incorrect and what happens with a generator.

### Issue with the Line
The line `print(d[i] if i in d else chr(ord(i)+3) for i in a)` attempts to use a generator expression directly within the `print` function. However, this is syntactically incorrect because `print` expects arguments, but a generator expression in this context does not produce a valid argument for `print`.

### Understanding the Generator
A generator expression like `(d[i] if i in d else chr(ord(i)+3) for i in a)` creates a generator object. A generator object is an iterator that lazily evaluates the expression and yields items one by one. When you try to print the generator object itself, you get something like `<generator object ...>`, which indicates that you have a generator but doesn't show its contents.

### Why You Get `<generator>`
When you execute `print(d[i] if i in d else chr(ord(i)+3) for i in a)`, the `print` function receives the generator object as an argument. Since `print` does not automatically iterate through the generator to print each item, it simply prints the generator object’s representation, which looks like `<generator object ...>`.

### Correct Approach
To fix this, you need to convert the generator to a list or a string, so that `print` can handle the contents properly.

Here’s the corrected line:
```python
# Using ''.join to convert the generator to a string
print(''.join(d[i] if i in d else chr(ord(i)+3) for i in a))
```

### Full Corrected Code
```python
d = {'x':'a', 'y':'b', 'z':'c', 'X':'A', 'Y':'B', 'Z':'C'}
a = ''.join([i.lower() if i.isupper() else i.upper() for i in str(input())])[::-1]

# Convert generator to a string and then print
print(''.join(d[i] if i in d else chr(ord(i)+3) for i in a))
```

This way, the generator expression is converted into a string, and `print` outputs the desired result.
