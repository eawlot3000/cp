Some common categories in competitive programming include:

Greedy algorithms
Dynamic programming
Graph algorithms (e.g., BFS, DFS, Dijkstra's algorithm)
Data structures (e.g., arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, heaps, trees)
Sorting and searching
Mathematics (e.g., number theory, combinatorics, geometry)
String algorithms
Divide and conquer
Backtracking
